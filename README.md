Created a one page Tic Tac Toe app using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There are 4 files, showing the progression I made throughout the project. ttt4.html is the final product. 

ttt1.html:
  Built a tic tac toe board using HTML and CSS. Created the 3 x3 grid of squares without using table. 
  Hard coded X's and O's onto the board to see what they would look. 

ttt2.html:
  redid this but used javaScript to create the squares. Added the player turn placement and where the win will be revealed.

ttt3.html:
  Allowed the players to click on squares and play the game. Shows who turn it is.

ttt4.html: 
  Tells players when the game is won or if there is a statemate, not allowing the board to be continued playing.
